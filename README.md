## Development

### Prerequisites

- [APS credentials](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/create-app)
- Provisioned access to [BIM 360 Docs](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/tutorials/getting-started/manage-access-to-docs/)
or Autodesk Construction Cloud
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (Long Term Support version is recommended)
- Command-line terminal such as [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview)
or [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (should already be available on your system)

> We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) which, among other benefits,
> provides an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics) as well.

### Setup & Run

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/aps-hubs-browser-nodejs`
- Go to the project folder: `cd aps-hubs-browser-nodejs`
- Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
- Open the project folder in a code editor of your choice
- Create a _.env_ file in the project folder, and populate it with the snippet below,
replacing `<client-id>` and `<client-secret>` with your APS Client ID and Client Secret,
and `<secret-phrase>` with an arbitrary string:

```bash
APS_CLIENT_ID="<client-id>"
APS_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>"
APS_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:8080/auth/callback" # URL your users will be redirected to after logging in with their Autodesk account
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET="<secret-phrase>" # phrase used to encrypt/decrypt server session cookies
```

> For applications deployed to a custom domain, the callback URL will be `http://<your-domain>/auth/callback`
> or `https://<your-domain>/auth/callback`. Do not forget to update the callback URL for your application
> in https://forge.autodesk.com/myapps as well.

- Run the application, either from your code editor, or by running `npm start` in terminal
- Open http://localhost:8080

> When using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), you can run & debug
> the application by pressing `F5`.
